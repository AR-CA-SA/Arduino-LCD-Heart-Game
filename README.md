# Arduino - Heart Mini Game
The following code executes a process designed for the Arduino UNO R3. This process relies on four digital inputs (buttons) to move the character up, down, left, or right to avoid the bullets.

## Hardware Components

* Arduino Uno
* 16x2 LCD
* 4 Push Buttons
* Potentiometer
* Breadboard and Jumper wires

## Gameply Overview

* Bullets spawn randomly left or right
* Player can move up, down, left, or right
* Collision triggers a “game over” animation

# Libraries used
- LiquidCrystal (built-in Arduino library)

## Future Improvements

-Multiple bullets
-Increasing difficulty
-Sound effects
